# Issue Resolved: Tenant Admin Redirect

## Problem
Tenant admin users were being redirected to `/dashboard` instead of `/tenant-admin` after login.

## Root Cause
The `src/components/auth/Login.tsx` component had a **hardcoded redirect** that was running BEFORE the LoginForm's smart redirect logic:

### Before (WRONG):
```typescript
// src/components/auth/Login.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (!state.isLoading && state.isAuthenticated) {
    router.push('/dashboard');  // ← HARDCODED!
  }
}, [state.isLoading, state.isAuthenticated, router]);
```

This meant:
1. User logs in successfully ✅
2. Backend returns correct flags (`isTenantAdmin: true`) ✅
3. User data is stored correctly in localStorage ✅
4. **BUT** the Login component immediately redirects to `/dashboard` ❌
5. LoginForm's smart redirect never gets a chance to run ❌

## Solution
Updated `Login.tsx` to use the smart redirect function that checks user type:

### After (CORRECT):
```typescript
// src/components/auth/Login.tsx
import { redirectToDashboard } from "@/lib/auth-redirect";

useEffect(() => {
  if (!state.isLoading && state.isAuthenticated) {
    console.log('[Login] User already authenticated, redirecting...');
    redirectToDashboard(router);  // ← SMART REDIRECT!
  }
}, [state.isLoading, state.isAuthenticated, router]);
```

Now the redirect logic:
1. Checks if user has `isTenantAdmin: true`
2. If yes → Redirects to `/tenant-admin` ✅
3. If no → Redirects to `/dashboard` ✅

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/components/auth/Login.tsx` - Fixed hardcoded redirect

## Testing
1. **Clear localStorage:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   ```

2. **Login with tenant admin credentials**

3. **Expected result:**
   - Console should show: `[Login] User already authenticated, redirecting...`
   - Should redirect to: `/tenant-admin`
   - Should see: Tenant Admin Dashboard

4. **Login with regular user**
   - Should redirect to: `/dashboard`
   - Should see: Regular User Dashboard

## Why This Happened
There were TWO components handling login:
1. `src/components/auth/Login.tsx` - Wrapper component with auth check
2. `src/app/login/LoginForm.tsx` - Actual form with submit logic

Both had redirect logic, but the wrapper's redirect ran FIRST (on auth state change), before the form's redirect could execute.

## Complete Flow (After Fix)

```
User submits login
       ↓
LoginForm calls login()
       ↓
Auth service stores user data
       ↓
Auth state changes to authenticated
       ↓
Login component useEffect triggers
       ↓
redirectToDashboard() checks user type
       ↓
   ┌──────────┴──────────┐
   ↓                     ↓
isTenantAdmin?      Regular User?
   ↓                     ↓
/tenant-admin        /dashboard
```

## Verification
Backend response was ALWAYS correct:
```json
{
  "isTenantAdmin": true,
  "userType": "tenantAdmin",
  "user": {
    "user_metadata": {
      "isTenantAdmin": true,
      "userType": "tenantAdmin"
    }
  }
}
```

The issue was purely in the frontend redirect logic. ✅

## Status
🎉 **RESOLVED** - Tenant admins now correctly redirect to `/tenant-admin`
